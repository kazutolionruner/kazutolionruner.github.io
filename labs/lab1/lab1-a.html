    <p>I have no idea</p>
    <p>I have worked 2 summers at Colony Brands. 
        I worked the 3rd shift my first summer and the 2nd shift my second summer. 
        This upcoming summer I will be receiving forklift training.

    <p>I am a Dungeons & Dragons Player. If I am a part of a D&D campaign,
        I will never miss a session. Even if I am on my deathbed, 
        I will still show up or partake, one way or another.
